Dealing with collecting, organizing and sharing web links has never been so easy!
You can mark your links with tags and add them to the storage through the custom Chrome extension. Then in Web app you can filter them out by different parameters and share results with your friends in couple clicks. You can track if you ever got back to the saved links with ‘Read’ feature and get your detailed reading habits statistics. Articles in our app have an ‘Author’ attribute so authors can claim them for a portfolios.
The main technologies used to create Bookit include React.js framework and Manifest V3 for Chrome Extension. A number of supporting technologies and libraries were utilized including: Ag-grid for our table and sharing view pages, Metascrapper.js to retrieve open graph data from our collected URLS, Plotly.js to render our user metrics graphs, react-select to create our dropdowns on both the web-app and plugin and Toastify.js to create user notifications.
